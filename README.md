# Flight-Booking-Airflow-CICD ✈️
Automated Flight Data Pipeline using Apache Airflow & CI/CD
## 📌 Overview
This project implements a fully automated ETL pipeline for flight booking data, integrating Apache Airflow, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud services (GCP) for seamless data processing and deployment. In this project as soon as data arrives in source location the file sensing will happen from a sensor and ETL job will gets triggered.
## 🚀 Key Features
✅ Airflow DAGs for scheduling & orchestration
✅ CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated testing & deployment
✅ Dockerized workflow for easy scalability
✅ Cloud integration (BigQuery / Redshift / S3 / Cloud Storage)
✅ PostgreSQL & Kafka for real-time data ingestion
## 🛠️ Tech Stack
