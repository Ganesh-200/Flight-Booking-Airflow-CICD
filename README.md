## 📌 Overview
This project implements a fully automated ETL pipeline for flight booking data, integrating Apache Airflow, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud services (GCP) for seamless data processing and deployment. In this project as soon as data arrives in source location the file sensing will happen from a sensor and ETL job will gets triggered.
## 🚀 Key Features
✅ **Airflow DAGs** for scheduling & orchestration  
✅ **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** for automated testing & deployment  
✅ **Cloud integration** (BigQuery / Cloud Storage)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
🔹 **Apache Airflow** – Workflow automation  
🔹 **MySQL** – Data storage  
🔹 **Apache Spark** – Batch Processing (Transformation)  
🔹 **GCP Services** – Composer, Dataproc Serverless, BigQuery, Cloud Storage  
🔹 **GitHub Actions** – CI/CD automation
